Welcome to the php tutorial, this tutorial will focus on command-line scripting in php. You may know php as web-oriented language. However its still scripting language and can be ran in command-line. This tutorial wont focus on web programming, but it will prepare you to solid web progamming.

This whole tutorial contains so-called interactive blocks. Theese are codeblocks that you can write into and run the code. This code is ran in your browser using [pib](https://github.com/) and emulates running in terminal - no html will be rendered. They are designed to try curent concept and not to write some projects, for that use repl.it or local environment.
